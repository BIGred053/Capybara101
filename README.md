#Testing With Capybara

##Work in Progress

__Skill Level:__ Beginner  
__Time Limit:__ 30 minutes  

The aim of this challenge is to introduce you to acceptance testing. Your job will be to create automate tests using Capybara & Cucumber that mimic a user logging into the site and navigating to a special page.

Capybara helps us test web applications by simulating how a real user would interact with an app. 

##Instructions
- fill in the username and password and login
- navigate the site and test to ensure that the correct pages are rendered with every click
